- title: 1930s Art Deco Dress
  desc: This was a commission for an art deco dress. The customer had no idea what she wanted so we showed her the Australian Home Journals from the appropriate era. She chose this beautiful design, from the May 1938 issue.<br/>It was made from linen and was of course guaranteed to be a perfect fit.
