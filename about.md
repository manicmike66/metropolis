<p>
I have been collecting and making vintage fashion clothing for 35 years and I am passionate about vintage style.  I enjoy restoring quality vintage garments and, when altering, always endeavour to maintain the integrity of the original design.
</p>
<p>
I use my own original patterns as well as vintage domestic patterns to create authentic vintage styles that are easily wearable in modern lifestyles.</p>
<p>
I have eighteen years industry experience in pattern making, both manual and using Lectra CAD software.  I'm a high level technician with innovative ideas, have broad knowledge of fabrics (their strengths and weakness) and I have seven years experience working in garment technology and quality assurance. 
</p>
<ul>I aim to:
<li> Produce the highest quality clothing I can</li>
<li> Make my customers happy</li>
<li> Support local businesses where possible</li>
<li> Choose environmental friendly and sustainable products</li>
<li> Create long lasting garments to support a sustainable environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Please enjoy browsing <a href="{{"shop" | relative_url}}">my online store</a> and <a href="{{"contact" | relative_url}}">contact me with any queries</a>, I am here to help you<br/>
