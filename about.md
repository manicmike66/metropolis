I have been collecting and making vintage fashion clothing for 35 years and I am passionate about vintage style.  I love restoring quality vintage garments and when altering, always endeavour to maintain the integrity of the original design. I use my own original patterns as well as vintage domestic patterns to create vintage styles that are easily wearable in modern lifestyles.</p>
<p>
I have eighteen years industry experience in pattern making, both manual and using Lectra CAD.  I am a high level technician with innovative ideas. I have broad knowledge of fabrics, their strengths and weakness, therefore best use for end product. I have 7 years experience working in garment technology and quality assurance. </p>
<ul>My values are to:
<li> produce the highest quality clothing possible</li>
<li> support local businesses where possible</li>
<li> choose environmental friendly and sustainable products</li>
<li> create long lasting garments to support a sustainable environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Please enjoy browsing my online store. Message me with any queries, I am here to help you<br/>
Helen xx
